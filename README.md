# Ray-Casting
Ray casting from a light source to random walls

Based on the Ray Casting lesson from The Coding Train but converted by myself to Python from .js

Uses my own VectorClass

Multiple Rays coming from a single light source using a Particle class

Some class methods are not used but the comments show which ones are not used
